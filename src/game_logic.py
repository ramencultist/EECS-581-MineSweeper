Module Name: game_logic.py
Description: Handle game logic and make calls to board_manager objects

Class Name: GameManager
Description: Handle all the hidden game state knowledge and set the states of the board, following the game logic

Update Description: Add the win condition and ignore already uncovered cells when revealing

Inputs: Mine count selection and reveal/flag actions from the input handler
Outputs: Board state updates, remaining flags, and win/loss status for the UI
External Sources: DeepSeek V4.1 Flash

Update 9/18/2026 - Alex Rawson
Introduce a simple adjacent-clear process that automatically uncovers all of the nodes in a 3x3 grid centered on the selected node if that node is not adjacent to a mine.
Additionally, make the game easier by ensuring the first click always reveals a node without an adjacent mine.
Update 9/16/2026 - Carter Steenhard and DeepSeek V4.1 Flash:
A description of how and why AI was used: DeepSeek V4.1 Flash used to add the win condition and the guard against revealing an already uncovered cell
How you validated and revised the AI output: Proofreading, logic tests for win, loss, repeated reveals, and flag counting, and a scripted window test of the status indicator
The challenges or limitations you faced while using AI: Keeping the win condition accurate when a cell is revealed more than once and matching the existing style
